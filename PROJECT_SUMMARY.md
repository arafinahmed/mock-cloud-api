# Mock Cloud API - Project Summary

## üéØ What Has Been Built

A complete mock cloud backend API that simulates real cloud infrastructure operations with the following components:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

1. **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`)
   - RESTful API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring

2. **Database Layer** (`app/database.py`, `app/models.py`)
   - PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Models for VMs, Volumes, Security Groups, and Environments
   - Automatic table creation and migration support

3. **Celery Worker** (`app/worker.py`)
   - Asynchronous task processing for resource creation
   - Realistic simulation: 30-60 second creation times
   - 1/10 random failure rate for testing error handling
   - Progress tracking and status updates

4. **Service Layer** (`app/services.py`)
   - Business logic for resource management
   - Integration between API and worker tasks
   - Resource lifecycle management

5. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/v1/endpoints/`)
   - **Environments**: Network isolation with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR ranges
   - **Security Groups**: Network security configuration
   - **VMs**: Virtual machine management (create, delete, list, get)
   - **Volumes**: Block storage with attach/detach capabilities

### üê≥ Infrastructure

- **Docker Compose** setup with:
  - PostgreSQL 15 database
  - RabbitMQ 3 message broker
  - Redis 7 for Celery backend
  - FastAPI application container
  - Celery worker container

- **Health checks** for all services
- **Persistent volumes** for data storage
- **Network isolation** between services

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Makefile** with common development commands
- **Startup scripts** for easy service management
- **Demo script** to test the API functionality
- **Comprehensive testing** setup

## üöÄ Key Features

### Realistic Cloud Simulation
- **Resource Creation**: VMs and volumes take 30-60 seconds to create
- **Failure Handling**: 10% random failure rate for testing resilience
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during resource creation
- **IP Assignment**: Random IP addresses in configured network ranges

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Task Queue**: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
- **Worker Pool**: Celery workers process tasks independently
- **Result Backend**: Redis stores task results and status
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more workers for increased throughput

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and status codes

## üîß Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd mock-cloud-api

# Start all services
./start.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose up -d

# Run demo
python demo.py
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres rabbitmq redis

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py

# Start API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start worker (in another terminal)
python scripts/start_worker.py
```

## üìä Monitoring & Management

- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Checks**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (mockcloud/mockcloud123)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on localhost:5432
- **Worker Logs**: `docker-compose logs -f worker`

## üß™ Testing

- **Unit Tests**: `pytest` for API endpoint testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with demo script
- **Load Testing**: Can be extended with tools like Locust
- **Error Simulation**: Built-in random failures for testing

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
